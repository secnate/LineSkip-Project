# LineSkip-Project

This is a project repository of the LineSkip app for iOS and Android phones that Nathan Pavlovsky and
Sadegh Sadeghi Tabas developed for the University of South Carolina's CSCE546 Spring 2019 class.
It won first place in the [University of South Carolina's _Backers and Hackers_ 2019 entepreneurship contest](https://www.cse.sc.edu/news/news/2019-backers-and-hackers-winners)

Video demo can be found [here](https://youtu.be/9enQzGKMnsM)

Tech stack used: Ionic Cordova with Typescript for the iOS/Android frontend and Firebase for the cloud-based database.

The repository contains the following:
- The [final project report](https://github.com/secnate/LineSkip-Project/blob/main/LineSkip%20Project%20Report.pdf) and [presentation](https://github.com/secnate/LineSkip-Project/blob/main/LINEUP_PITCH.pptx) with a full explanation and overview of what was done
- The [pitch slide deck](https://github.com/secnate/LineSkip-Project/blob/main/LINEUP_PITCH.pptx), which was the inspiration for the project getting started
- A complete collection of [the final application's screenshots](https://github.com/secnate/LineSkip-Project/tree/main/Screenshots)
- The complete collection of the code is located [in a Zip repository](https://github.com/secnate/LineSkip-Project/tree/main/Screenshots) due to issues with uploading such a large number of files directly. NOTE: the functionality for connecting to the Firebase backend database is functional *but inactive* due to the API key referencing a deleted Firebase account
